# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Define public values that are prone to changes when ran on different circumstances/environments
#
# These values can be altered safely from env variables and is
# HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to be altered on env variables to express system's adaptibility
#
# Notes:
# - Document what the env variable does to the system on README.md (highly recommended)
# - Make sure you ALWAYS have a default value when env variable is omitted (even if its nil or "")
# - Prefix your env variable with 'RAILS_' to avoid conflict with other env variables
# - It's also recommended to add a second prefix to shortly categorize its usecase
#   Example: 'RAILS_CARRIERWAVE_', 'RAILS_DEVISE_', RAILS_MODEL_NAME_', 'RAILS_MODULE_NAME_', 'RAILS_METHOD_NAME_' etc.
